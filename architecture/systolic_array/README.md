### Systolic array definition for [timeloop](https://github.com/Accelergy-Project/accelergy-timeloop-infrastructure) simulator

The systolic array for the Timeloop-Accelergy simulator is inspired on [basic design samples](https://github.com/Accelergy-Project/timeloop-accelergy-exercises/tree/master/workspace/baseline_designs/example_designs)
Execution command:
```bash
timeloop-mapper arch/*.yaml /arch/components/*.yaml ../constraints/*.yaml mapper/*.yaml ../prob/*.yaml -o ../output/ -v 1
```
